		<h2><div> Girl Gone So Weak <ol></h2>
			<div>
			<ol>	
			<li>A curve thats upside down</li>
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; A smile thats turned into frown
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; Tears rolling down her cheeks
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; Shes been depressed for a couple of weeks
				<div></div>
			<li>She likes to cut her wrist</li>
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; She wished she didnt exist
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; Afraid to look at herself in the mirror
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; Criticism, such a predictable horror.
				<div></div>
			<li>She eats her lunch in a toilet seat</li>
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; And cries her pain between her feet
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; Shes not a weirdo, not a freak
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; Shes just a girl, gone so weak

			<li>Poems,</li>
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; I shall write for her
				<br> &emsp; &emsp;A poem so beautiful,
				<br> &emsp; &emsp;It reflects her soul
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; A poem so innocent
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; Like her 2 year old self
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; A poem so addictive
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; Like the way she bites her lip
				<div></div>
			<li>A poem so deep,</li>
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; Just liker her mind
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; A poem so mysterious,
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; It describes her personality
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; A poem so happy,
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; Like the way she makes me feel
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; A poem so carefree
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; Like the way she moves
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; A poem so bright
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; Like the stars she love
				<div></div>
			<li>A poem so elegant, </li>
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; Like her collection of dresses
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; A poem so toxic
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; Like her doubts
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; A poem so meaningful
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; Just like her life
				<div></div>
			<li>All these poems</li>
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; For one girl
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; Or I shall rather say:
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; One girl,
				<br> &emsp; &emsp; For all these poems
