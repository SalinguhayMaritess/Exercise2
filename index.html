			<li>A curve thats upside down</li>
				<br>A smile thats turned into frown
				<br>Tears rolling down her cheeks
				<br>Shes been depressed for a couple of weeks
				</div>
		<div>
		<li>She likes to cut her wrist</li>
			<br>She wished she didnt exist
			<br>Afraid to look at herself in the mirror
			<br>Criticism, such a predictable horror.
		</div>
<div>
		<li>She eats her lunch in a toilet seat</li>
			<br>And cries her pain between her feet
			<br>Shes not a weirdo, not a freak
			<br>Shes just a girl, gone so weak

		<div> Poems <ol>
			<li>Poems,</li>
				<br>I shall write for her
				<br>A poem so beautiful,
				<br>It reflects her soul
				<br>A poem so innocent
				<br>Like her 2 year old self
				<br>A poem so addictive
				<br>Like the way she bites her lip
			<li>A poem so deep,</li>
				<br>Just liker her mind
				<br>A poem so mysterious,
				<br>It describes her personality
				<br>A poem so happy,
				<br>Like the way she makes me feel
				<br>A poem so carefree
				<br>Like the way she moves
				<br>A poem so bright
				<br>Like the stars she love
			<li>A poem so elegant, </li>
				<br>Like her collection of dresses
				<br>A poem so toxic
				<br>Like her doubts
				<br>A poem so meaningful
				<br>Just like her life
			<li>All these poems</li>
				<br>For one girl
				<br>Or I shall rather say:
				<br>One girl,
				<br>For all these poems
			</ol>
