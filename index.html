				 <h6 style="font-family:Century;"> -an originally created poem </h6>
		
		<div> First stanza <ol>
			
			<li>A curve thats upside down</li>
				<br>A smile thats turned into frown
				<br>Tears rolling down her cheeks
				<br>Shes been depressed for a couple of weeks
				</div>
					</ol>
		<div> Second stanza <ol>
			<li>She likes to cut her wrist</li>
						<br>She wished she didnt exist
						<br>Afraid to look at herself in the mirror
						<br>Criticism, such a predictable horror.
						</div>
							</ol>
		<div> Third stanza <ol>
			<li>She eats her lunch in a toilet seat</li>
								<br>And cries her pain between her feet
								<br>Shes not a weirdo, not a freak
								<br>Shes just a girl, gone so weak
							</ol>
							</li>
